The project uses the Next.js App Router. Here are the key files:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx        # Main entry point with the dashboard component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx      # Root layout
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css     # Tailwind CSS directives
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scrape.ts   # API endpoint for web scraping (to be created)

üîÑ Data Fetching: From Dummy to Live Data

Currently, the component in app/page.tsx uses static dummy data for demonstration purposes.
To make the application dynamic, you need to implement a web scraping API endpoint.

1. Create the API Route

Create a file at:

pages/api/scrape.ts

2. Implement Scraping Logic

Use libraries like axios and cheerio to fetch and parse HTML from the official IPL website.
Inspect the live website to find the correct CSS selectors for the data you want.

3. Fetch from Frontend

Modify the useEffect hook in app/page.tsx to fetch data from your /api/scrape endpoint instead of using local dummyData.

Example:

// Inside the App component in app/page.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  setLoading(true);
  fetch('/api/scrape') // Fetch from your API route
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(setData)
    .catch(err => console.error("Failed to fetch data", err))
    .finally(() => setLoading(false));
}, []);


‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Web scraping can be fragile.
If the source website‚Äôs HTML structure changes, your scraper may break.
Always include robust error handling.
